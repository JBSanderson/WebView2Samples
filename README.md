## 2. WebView2 API Samples

The Samples demonstrate all of the WebView2 SDK's features and their API use patterns. As we add more features to the WebView2 SDK, we will regularly update our sample applications. See [WebView2Samples.sln](./WebView2Samples.sln) that includes all three projects below:

* Win32 C/C++ Sample can be found within [WebView2APISample](./WebView2APISample) directory.
* WPF Sample can be found within [WebView2WpfBrowser](./WebView2WpfBrowser) directory.
* Windows Forms Sample can be found within [WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser](./WebView2WindowsFormsBrowser) directory.

## 3. WebView2 Browser Example

Clone the [WebView2Browser](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser) by running `git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser.git` to get started.

Follow the [WebView2Browser guide](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser) to learn how to build an application that utilizes multiple WebViews.
